1)In Excel, the dollar sign ($) is used to create absolute cell references. It allows you to lock a specific row, column, or both in a formula so that when you copy or move the formula to another cell, the reference does not change.

2)Select the cell that contains the formula
Select the reference you want to change in the formula bar
Press F4 to switch between reference types

3)Parentheses: Calculations within parentheses are evaluated first, from the innermost to the outermost
Exponents: Exponents are evaluated next
Multiplication and Division: These operations are evaluated from left to right
Addition and Subtraction: These operations are evaluated from left to right

4)These are the 5 basic Excel functions that everyone should know:
The VLookup Function.
The Concatenate Function.
Text to Columns.
Remove Duplicates.
Pivot Tables.

5)To use the subtotal function, you can: 
Type =SUBTOTAL
Select the function you want to use, such as 9 for sum or 1 for average
Select the reference, which is your data
Press enter
The subtotal function can be used with other functions, like AVERAGE or COUNT, to find custom totals from a dataset

6)The syntax for the VLOOKUP function in Excel is: 
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_range, column_number, [match])
lookup_value: The value you want to look up
lookup_range: The data range where you'll search for the lookup_value
column_number: The number of the column in the lookup_range that contains the matching value to return
match: An optional parameter to choose either closest or exact match
